## About The Project

Blah blah blah ... I make FarmHelper work on pojav because people at JellyLab couldn't care less. Check Github Actions for releases and no this is not a rat. All I changed was using vigilance and removed a few features incompatible with phone.

## Contributing

Make sure contributed code actually works!!!
